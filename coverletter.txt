Dear Munich Re Recruiter,
\vspace{5pt} \\
I am delighted to express my interest in data scientist of Munich Re as advertised in School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering career center in Indiana University Bloomington. I am graduating with my Master's Degree in Data Science in May 2018, but also have undergraduate degree in Statistics and Economics. I believe my multi-backgrounds equipped me with analytic, modeling, programming, and business communication skills needed for this position.
\vspace{15pt} \\

To prepare to be a data scientist, I have developed strong analytic and modeling skills. Throughout my college time in Indiana University. I not only finished more credit hours than I should take, but also became a research assistance of my professor. We were interested predicting molecule energy given the geometry location. The project required me to use a 133k molecules dataset, two programming languages (R and Python), and different libraries to developed machine learning algorithms such as kernel ridge regression and neural network. To speed up computations, I implemented some programs in parallel on a supercomputer, Karst, in IU. At the end of the program, we brought down the error from 138 to 6, which dramatically improved the accuracy. From this experience, I have learned that I am a self-starter who tries to solve problems, and I am eager to learn new techniques, and who wants to use analytic and modeling skills for business success.
\vspace{15pt} \\
I am confident that my past experience and my academic success in machine learning make me an excellent candidate for the data scientist with Munich Re. Thank you for your consideration and reading my letter. I look forward to meeting with you and discussing my qualification in more detail.
\vspace{15pt} \\
Sincerely,
\vspace{50pt} \\
